Task 1

 The first thing I did was to get my necessary tools up running which are oracle SQL developer tool, Oracle Database 11 and IBM SPSS statistics.

 Question A) was solved by connecting on my SQL developer, creating a Table called USER_SALES and importing the datasheet file from my project folder.
 Then to calculate the Monthly sales by site, I need the sql statement and just 3 columns from the table USER_SALES (site, creation time and sale value).
 Sql statement is now applied by grouping them and ordering them accordingly. The same method applies to the payment method per month.


 

 Question C) was solved using the Hotels_visits file. SQL statement is also applied here by subtracting the hotel_login_time
 from the lag hotel_login_time which is the login before, then taking the average from the two logins and ordering them.



 Question D) was solved from Hotels_visits file where we have new_user_category. Account id was divided by distinct Account id (Account id which appears more than once). 
After grouping and ordering command, The average number of visit by New and Old users is gotten.


Question E) Calculating the correlation we have to use SPSS, this is to compare between trades and sales. After the data was imported from the file user_sales.
I represented the payment_type by by numbers. on the table I chose Analyse-->correlate-->Byvariate and  trades to sales value were so close positive value. 
If negative, there is no correlation.

Question F) This was solved by first writing a query for selecting the old_account id and new_account id from user_trades table and grouping them by furni_type.
 It appears they both have the same Furni-type choice.


Task 2) This was solved by creating a table called purchase and gave it like five atrributes. I did the same for new_purchase which hold information about the daily purchases of new users.
Then a pseudo code is written to trigger new_purchase which means wherever you see purchase it will be replaced with new_purchase with all it's new attributes populate in a new columm.
Then a command is thrown to display all new_purchases table. The old date was added in the code in order to put the present date of the new_purchase.
